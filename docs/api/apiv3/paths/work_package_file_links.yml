    Creates file links on a work package.

    The request body must contain the generated storage token, and not the storage id. In addition, the request must
    send the origin file id and the stored meta data.
    
    If there is already a link on the given work package with the same file id from the same storage, the previous
    data is not overwritten.
    
    As it is possible to link folders from a storage to a work package, the _mimeType_ of this entity can be empty.
