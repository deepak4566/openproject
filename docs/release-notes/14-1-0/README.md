# OpenProject 14.1.0

Release date: 2024-05-13

We released [OpenProject 14.1.0](https://community.openproject.org/versions/2030). The release contains several bug fixes and we recommend updating to the newest version. In these Release Notes, we will give an overview of important feature changes. At the end, you will find a complete list of all changes and bug fixes.

## Important feature changes

### PDF export of Gantt view, e.g. for printing (Enterprise add-on)

It is now possible to export a Gantt view as PDF in the OpenProject Enterprise edition. This allows users to easily print Gantt charts in a nice design. Choose between different paper formats, set the column width, and specify whether the PDF file should display your work packages on a daily, monthly or quarterly basis.

Please note that we plan to further improve the PDF export of Gantt view in future releases.

### Favorite projects

This feature was requested by many in the Community and will be a great benefit, especially for organizations with many projects: OpenProject 14.1 allows you to add projects to favorites so that they can be found more quickly. We [recently gave an overview in our blog](https://www.openproject.org/blog/favorite-projects/) of how exactly you can add projects to favorites or remove them from favorites – and where you can display them.

See our documentation to learn more about [how to mark a project as favorite](https://www.openproject.org/docs/user-guide/project-overview/#mark-a-project-as-favorite).

### Advanced features for the Meetings module

The Meetings module is currently being continuously improved. With OpenProject 14.1...

- you can group agenda items with sections,
- notes are open when creating new agenda items,
- and the status now changes to open when you copy a closed meeting.

Apart from these features that apply the Meetings module directly, the following changes concerning OpenProject meetings have been made:

- In work packages, the project name is now shown in the Meetings tab.
- Calendar widgets on the My Page and project overview pages can now show meetings.

**Please note**: On the project overview page, the "+" button on the top right has been removed. You can now only add widgets by hovering at the border of an existing widget and click on the "+" there. 

### Possibility to hide attachments in the Files tab

Admins now are able to hide the attachment section in the Files tab. This setting can be changed at a project level and is particularly useful for projects where users should only upload files via external storage, e.g. Nextcloud.

### Custom fields of the type Link (URL)

Users can now create custom field of the type Link (URL). Remember to activate it for your project(s) and specific work package type for it to be displayed. The custom field type Link shows an error message if you type in an invalid URL.

### Save a changed sort order of custom project lists

Custom project lists can now not only be changed in order, but also saved as such. Additionally, you can change your own saved lists and save them again so that you do not have to start from scratch.

### A "Manage project attributes" button on the project overview page

With OpenProject 14.0, we released the feature to create a custom set of project attributes grouped in sections on the project overview page. With 14.1, you will additionally have a button to "Manage project attributes" on the project overview page.

### OneDrive/SharePoint: A "no permission“ message to file links

If you use the OneDrive/SharePoint integration, you will now be shown a "no permission" message if you try to access a file for which you lack permission.
