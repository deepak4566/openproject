# Add work packages to meetings

Since the 13.1 Release work packages can be added directly to the meetings. This can be done either from the detailed view of a work package or from the [detailed view of a meeting](../../meetings/dynamic-meetings#add-a-work-package-to-the-agenda).

To add a work package open the detailed view of a work package, select the **Meetings** tab and click the **+Add to meeting** button.

You will also see which meetings, both past and upcoming, a work package has already been linked to.

A dialogue will open allowing you to select a meeting from the list of existing upcoming meetings. You can open that list by using the dropdown menu. You can also add the notes and click **Save**.
