# File Management FAQs

## Why am I not allowed to see/read a certain file in OneDrive/SharePoint?

It is possible that you lack the necessary permissions to view a certain file. In this case please contact your administrator. 
Another explanation may be that you have been removed from a project in OpenProject, which will also mean that you lost your viewing or reading privileges in OneDrive/SharePoint project folders.
