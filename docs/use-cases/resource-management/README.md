# Use Case: Resource Management

**Note:**  OpenProject does not have the automated functionality to provide detailed resource management or employee work capacity calculations. However, there is a workaround that you can use to configure a visual estimate of task attribution and plan accordingly. 

These are the steps you can follow to adjust a work package overview to suit your goals.

Step 1: Select a project and go to the work package overview by clicking **Work packages** in the project menu on the left. If you would like to create an overview over multiple projects, select the respective projects and/or subprojects in the **Include projects** menu between the **+ Create** and the **Filter** buttons. 

Alternatively, you can also chose the **Global work package overview** by selecting the **Waffle icon** in the top right corner:

![OpenProject global work packages overview](openproject_global_wp_view.png)

Step 2: Either use existing fields, for example **Estimated time** and **Spent time**, or [create custom fields](../../system-admin-guide/custom-fields/) (i.e. **Est. Scope (h)** and **Time spent (h)**) to adjust the work packages overview.

Step 3: You can either insert the standard or existing fields to the view, or insert the custom fields if created in Step 2.

Step 4: You can add any filters necessary and and sort or group the work packages by assignee.

Step 5: Save your adjusted view by clicking on the **Save** icon on the left (you can name this view before saving or re-name it later). ![Save adjusted openrpoject workpage view](openproject_save_wp_adjusted_view.png)

This view will be saved and shown under your private work package filters.

You could also add the Gantt view to add an additional dimension to your overview.

This will provide a rough overview of the various tasks assigned to a specific person or team. Adding the Gantt view provides a supplementary overview of when these tasks are scheduled. It is a visual way of looking at approximately how many tasks are assigned to an individual. This view gives you an estimate about the timeline, allowing for adjustments in assignments and timing to be made to balance your resources. 

These functions can help focus in on showing relevant results only. Using filters and the (+) zoom function will help to focus the Gantt view to only the tasks that are scheduled for example for the next 30 days. 

You can also use the sum function. Select **[â‹®]** -> ***Configure view*** -> ***Display settings*** -> and check ***Display Sums*** box:

**Limitations:** While this workaround provides a visual estimate of who works on what and when, it does not replace a dedicated capacity management tool.
