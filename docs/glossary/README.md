# OpenProject Glossary

## Accessibility mode

OpenProject offers an accessibility mode which is defined as an optimized user interface for physically disabled users. The accessibility mode can be activated in the account settings (System preferences). Note: When activated, the backlogs plugin cannot be used. Accessibility is an important topic for OpenProject and we strive to comply to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). Nevertheless, accessibility is a big field which takes time to implement and not all elements in OpenProjects are barrier-free - yet.

## Agile project management

Agile project management is an iterative and flexible approach to managing projects. It focuses on collaboration, adaptability, and self-organizing teams. OpenProject supports agile project management as well as *classic project management* and works best for *hybrid project management*.

## Authentication

In Openproject, authentication is an important element to guarantee a data protected usage. To adapt these authentication settings, navigate to your user name and select -> Administration -> Authentication. At OpenProject, we use *OAuth 2.0* as this is this is the definitive industry standard for online authorization.
