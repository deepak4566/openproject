# OpenProject 4.1 to OpenProject 4.2 Debian/Ubuntu Upgrade Guide

Please look at the steps in the section about the upgrade to OpenProject 4.1. Just exchange `v4.1.0` to `v4.2.0` when checking out the git repository.

# OpenProject 4.0 to OpenProject 4.1 Debian/Ubuntu Upgrade Guide

This guide describes the upgrade process from OpenProject 4.0 to 4.1 on Debian 7.7 and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS step by step.

Note: We strongly recommend to update your OpenProject installation to the latest available 4.0 version (currently 4.0.9), before attempting an update to 4.1.


## Preparation

* Backup your current Openproject installation. Typically you should backup the attachment
  folder of your installation, the subversion repositories (if applicable) and your database.
  For more information please have a look at our [backup guide](backup-guide.md)

* Before Upgrading, check that all the installed OpenProject plugins support the new
  OpenProject version. Remove incompatible plugins before attempting an upgrade. Stop
  the OpenProject Server. You may even add a maintenance page, if you feel comfortable
  with that.

* If you run the worker process with a cronjob, disable the cronjob temporarily.
* Stop the (delayed\_job) worker process. In case you run the woker process through
  `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec script/delayed_job start`, execute the following:
  `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec script/delayed_job stop`.

## Update your system

```bash
[root@debian]# apt-get update
[root@debian]# apt-get upgrade
```

## Get the new OpenProject Source Code
Change into the directory where OpenProject is installed and switch to the operating-system-user the OpenProject operates as. We assume that OpenProject is installed in `/home/openproject/openproject` by the `openproject` user.

```bash
[root@debian]# su - openproject -c "bash -l"
[openproject@debian]# cd ~/openproject/openproject
```

Remove manual changes and modifications (If you have modified OpenProject source files and want to preserve those changes, back up your changes, and re-apply them later):

```bash
[openproject@debian]# git reset --hard
[openproject@debian]# git fetch
[openproject@debian]# git checkout v4.1.0
```

## Upgrade Ruby
OpenProject 4.1 requires Ruby to be installed in version 2.1.x. Assuming you have installed Ruby via RVM, do the following to upgrade your Ruby installation:

```bash
[openproject@debian]# rvm get stable
[openproject@debian]# export -f rvm_debug
[openproject@debian]# rvm install 2.1.5
[openproject@debian]# rvm use --default 2.1.5
[openproject@debian]# gem install bundler
[openproject@debian]# bundle install
```

### Update application server configuration
This sections only applies to you, if you serve OpenProject via Apache and Passenger. If you serve OpenProject in a different way, be sure to check that it still works.

During the upgrade of the Ruby version, we have potentially installed a new Ruby and Passenger version. The versions of Ruby and Passenger appear in the Apache configuration like this:

```apache
LoadModule passenger_module /home/openproject/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.4/gems/passenger-4.0.53/buildout/apache2/mod_passenger.so
<IfModule mod_passenger.c>
  PassengerRoot /home/openproject/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.4/gems/passenger-4.0.53
  PassengerDefaultRuby /home/openproject/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.4/wrappers/ruby
</IfModule>
```
Please run the following commands to upgrade passenger and re-install the Apache module:

```bash
[openproject@debian]# gem update passenger
[openproject@debian]# gem cleanup passenger
[openproject@debian]# passenger-install-apache2-module
```

The output of passenger-install-apache2-module2 tells you how to configure Apache. It is basically the same as what is already installed, except for the updated version numbers.

Donâ€™t forget to restart apache after the configuration change:

```bash
[root@debian]# service apache2 reload
```

## Node.js installation
Node.js is necessary to precompile the assets (JavaScript and CSS). We will install the latest 0.12.x version of Node.js via nodeenv:

```bash
[openproject@debian]# exit
[root@debian]# apt-get install python python-pip
[root@debian]# pip install nodeenv
[root@debian]# su - openproject -c "bash -l"
[openproject@debian]# cd /home/openproject
[openproject@debian]# nodeenv nodeenv
[openproject@debian]# source ./nodeenv/bin/activate
[openproject@debian]# npm -g install bower
```

As a reference, the following Node.js and NPM versions have been installed on our system:

```bash
[openproject@debian]# node --version
                      v0.12.2
[openproject@debian]# npm --version
                      1.4.28
[openproject@debian]# bower --version
                      1.3.12
```

## The Upgrade

Now that the sources and dependencies are in place, you can migrate the Database and do the upgrade:

```bash
[openproject@debian]# cd /home/openproject/openproject
[openproject@debian]# npm install
[openproject@debian]# RAILS_ENV="production" bundle exec rake db:migrate
[openproject@debian]# RAILS_ENV="production" bundle exec rake db:seed
[openproject@debian]# RAILS_ENV="production" bundle exec rake assets:precompile
[openproject@debian]# touch tmp/restart.txt
```

*Side note:* If you are using `RAILS_ENV="development"` the task `bundle exec rake assets:webpack` needs to be run. This step is not necessary for `production` because it is part of the `asset:precompile` tasks.

**NOTE** `db:seed` can also be invoked with a 'LOCALE' environment variable defined, specifying the language in which to seed. Note however, that specifying different locales for calls to `db:seed` might lead to a mixture of languages in your data. It is therefore advisable to use the same language for all calls to `db:seed`.

## The Aftermath
* Re-enable the `delayed_job` cron job that was disabled in the first step.
* If you have put up a maintenance page, remove it.
* Start the OpenProject server again
* Watch for further OpenProject updates in our news, or on twitter.
