# ToDo: Whiy is this file necessary? Where is documentation about the RoR loader? Zeitwerk?
# This standard guide explains Zeitwerk, but does not explain the "require" below.
# https://guides.rubyonrails.org/autoloading_and_reloading_constants.html
# ToDo: Also: Why is this file called openproject-storages.rb? Where is this convention explained?
# This doesn't seem to follow Zeitwerk conventions.
require 'open_project/storages'
