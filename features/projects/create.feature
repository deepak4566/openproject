Feature: Creating Projects
  Background:
    Given there is 1 project with the following:
      | name        | parent      |
      | identifier  | parent      |
    And I am already admin

  @javascript
  Scenario: Creating a Subproject
    When I go to the settings page of the project "parent"
    And I follow "New subproject"
    And I fill in "project_name" with "child"
    And I press "Create"
    Then I should be on the settings page of the project called "child"

  Scenario: Creating a Subproject
    When I go to the settings page of the project "parent"
    And I follow "New subproject"
    Then I should not see "Responsible"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Creating a Project with an already existing identifier
    When I go to the projects admin page
    And I follow "New project"
    And I fill in "project_name" with "Parent"
    And I press "Create"
    Then I should be on the projects page
    And I should see "Identifier has already been taken"
    And I fill in "project_name" with "Parent 2"
    And the "Identifier" field should contain "parent-2" within "#content"
