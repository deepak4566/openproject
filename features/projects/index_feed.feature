    Given there is 1 project with the following:
      | identifier | omicronpersei8 |
      | name       | omicronpersei8 |
    And there is a role "CanViewProject"

    And I am already logged in as "bob"

   Scenario: Atom feed enabled
     When I go to the projects page
     Then I should see "Also available in" within ".other-formats"
      And I should see "Atom" within ".other-formats span"

   Scenario: Atom feed disabled
    Given the "feeds_enabled" setting is set to false
     When I go to the projects page
     Then I should not see "Also available in"
