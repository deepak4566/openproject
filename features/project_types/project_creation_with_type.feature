Feature: Project creation with support for project type
  As a ChiliProject Admin
  I want to set a project type when creating a project
  So that the default planning element types are enabled automatically

  Background:
    Given there are the following types:
          | Name           | Is default |
          | Phase          | true       |
          | Milestone      | false      |
          | Something else | false      |

      And there are the following project types:
          | Name                  |
          | Standard Project      |
          | Extraordinary Project |

  Scenario: The admin may create a project with a project type
    Given I am already admin
    When I go to the admin page
    And I follow the first link matching "Projects"
    And I follow "New project"
    Then I fill in "Fancy Pants" for "Name"
    And I fill in "fancy-pants" for "Identifier"
    And I check "Timelines"
    And I select "Standard Project" from "Project type"
    And I press "Create"
    Then I should see a notice flash stating "Successful creation."
    When the following types are enabled for projects of type "Standard Project"
      | Phase     |
      | Milestone |
    And I go to the "types" tab of the settings page of the project called "Fancy Pants"
    Then the "Phase" checkbox should be checked
    And the "Milestone" checkbox should be checked
