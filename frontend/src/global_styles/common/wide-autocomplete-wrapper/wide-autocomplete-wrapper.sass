/* This block is currently only used as an `appendTo` option
 * for ng-select instances that need an option dropdown list that
 * is wider than the input field it is attached to.
 *
 * You can use this by adding `appendTo=".op-wide-autocomplete-wrapper"`
 * to any ng-select instance that needs it.
 * 
 * Unfortunately, there does not seem to be a better way to select
 * a specific ng-dropdown-panel than appending it in a DOM
 * element that you can select.
 * 
 * This makes the panel wider to the right hand side,
 * so it is most likely to be cut off there.
