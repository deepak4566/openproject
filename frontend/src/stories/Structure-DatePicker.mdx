# Structure: Date picker

## Design

### What it is and when to use it

- Date picker is used to allow users to input dates visually (by clicking on a calendar sheet)
- Can be attached to input fields (drop modal) or embedded in modals (Baseline, work package date picker)

### How it works

A date picker's behaviour depends on the type of date picker (work package, settings, single-date, range...) and is specific to each instance.

#### Mobile-specific

A date picker can be displayed in two ways on mobile screens:

- A mobile version of the modal that contains the date picker (Work package date picker, Baseline...)
- Native mobile version for a basic date picker attached to a date input

### Variations

None. (Removed header?)

### Options

- Working days only (non-working days are not clickable)
- All days (working days are indicated but remain clickable)

### States

- Selected (single date)
	- All corners rounded
- Selected (date range)
	- Start/finish: one side rounded
	- Spanned dates: highlighted
- Today
- Non-working days
- Disabled: all of the above states can be disabled, which will still indicate all these states but in shades of grey.


### Design notes

- Date format depends on user / instance settings
- Certain dates can be disabled by other functions (relations)

### Accessibility

- Contrast ratios respected
- Individual date selection not possible via keyboard navigation, known Flatpickr issue
	- If selectable, label ("13") is not enough; screen reader should read the full date, "Friday, 13 October, 2023")
