# Selector Field

> Example: Checkbox with 3 items with hierarchy, showing 3 modes (mixed, checked and unchecked), and 2 states (enabled and disabled). A set of three radio buttons (unselected, selected, disabled).

Selector fields are used to offer the user a number of different options.

The selector field consists of either a checkbox or a radio button along with a label. 

Checkboxes offer the possibility to make multiple selections. 
Radio buttons require the user to choose only one from a list of options.

## Behaviour

The selector field extends the clickable zone of the checkbox or radio button to the entire label. Clicking on the label is then the same as clicking on the control element itself.

If the label text is particular long, it should wrap within the container, but be top-aligned, like so:

> Example: A checkbox wrapping around when the item label is very long

## States

The selector field itself only has two states, *enabled* and *disabled*.

> Example: Checkboxes and radio buttons in both enabled and disabled states

## Positioning and Margins

Because the selector field itself is often placed in containers that have their own margins (like the action bar), it does not inherently have any margins of its own.

Note however the 2 REM space between the element and the label.
