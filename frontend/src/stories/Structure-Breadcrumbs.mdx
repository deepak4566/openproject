# Structure: Breadcrumbs

## Design

### What it is and when to use it

Breadcrumbs provide important semantic context to information being presented on the screen by allowing users to identify where they are in a hierarchical structure.

Breadcrumbs allow users to:

- identify their current location (in a folder structure or hierarchy of work packages)
- navigate up to the parent(s)

<Canvas of={StructureBreadcrumbsStories.Default} />

Breadcrumbs consist of a series of "levels" presented horizontally, separated by a right arrow (▶). Each level is a child of the level preceding it, except the first level, which is the root.

<Canvas of={StructureBreadcrumbsStories.FourLevels} />

### Behaviour

The last level is always the current level; this is never clickable. All other levels (the parents) are links, and clicking on them will take users to that level.

Because the length of the breadcrumb can vary significantly (depending on the title of each level and the available space), it can condense to fit the available space:

- The breadcrumb can show four (4) levels in full, space permitting, before going to "collapsed" mode.
- If the available space in the parent container not does afford sufficient width to display the four levels in full, the middle levels are truncated with ellipses ("Root ▶ Second le... ▶ Third le... ▶ Fourth level").

<Canvas of={StructureBreadcrumbsStories.FiveLevels} />

#### Mobile-specific

There are special rules on mobile:

- The root level shows only an icon and ellipses ("...", fully truncated).
- The direct parent (...) is displayed as non-shrinkable ellipses that are clickable
- Further parents (between the direct parent and the root) are not displayed
- The current level maybe be truncated with ellipses ("[Icon] ... ▶ ... ▶ Current le...) if needed.

To view the mobile style, reduce the viewport width of your browser below 680px.

### Options

Each item can consist of an icon and text.

The icon is generally only used for the first item, although it possible for to display it at any level if necessary.

### Accessibility

The user should be able to use the Tab key to navigate between different levels, and press Enter to click. 

Truncated levels (...) are not keyboard accessible, but neither are they clickable.
