<Meta title="Story Structure" />

The following is a general outline for structuring stories for components and patterns. This outline does not apply to _Styles_.

_Note: Some components and patterns are more complex than others and there will naturally be small variations in structure._

_Note 2: We are currently working on applying this structure across all components and patterns, but this is a work in progress. Some pages are currently differently structured than others._

# Title

Immediately after the title, describe what the component is, its purpose and when to use it. If relevant, also mention what it isn't.

## Behaviour

Here, describe how the component behaves: what kind of interaction it affords, how it changes based on certain constraints (eg. how text is wrapped, when label is too long, when it is disabled...).

### Mobile behaviour

Describe any mobile-specific behaviour.

## Variations

Describe different variations, types or styles. Additional sections like "Types" or "States" may be added if necessary.

## Special considerations

If relevant, add any additional important information that might help the reader understand peculiarities and oddities. (For example, if certain colours, formating options depend on user or admin settings and might differ from the illustrations).

## Accessibility

If there are specific notes concerning accessibility, they can be noted here. 

## Usage

This section will illustrate different cases (particularly from an implementation point of view) with code examples.
