                      * The Product Owner presents the [Product Backlog]({{opSetting:base_url}}/projects/your-scrum-project/backlogs) and the priorities to the team and explains the Sprint Goal, to which the team must agree. Together, they prioritize the topics from the Product Backlog which the team will take care of in the next sprint. The team commits to the discussed delivery.
                      * The team plans autonomously (without the Product Owner) in detail and breaks down the tasks from the discussed requirements to consolidate a [Sprint Backlog]({{opSetting:base_url}}/projects/your-scrum-project/backlogs).

                      * What has blocked my work (Impediments)?
                  * Scrum Master moderates and notes down [Sprint Impediments](##sprint:scrum_project__version__sprint_1).
                  * Product Owner may participate may participate in order to stay informed.

                  * Important: no dummies and no PowerPoint! Just finished product functionality (Increments) should be demonstrated.
                  * Feedback from Product Owner, stakeholders and others is desired and will be included in further work.
                  * Based on the demonstrated functionalities, the Product Owner decides to go live with this increment or to develop it further. This possibility allows an early ROI.
