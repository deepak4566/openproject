# Similar to regular Journals, but under the following circumstances journals are aggregated:
#  * they are in temporal proximity
#  * they belong to the same resource
#  * they were created by the same user (i.e. the same user edited the journable)
#  * no other user has an own journal on the same object between the aggregated ones
# When a user commented (added a note) twice within a short time, the second comment will
# "open" a new aggregation, since we do not want to merge comments in any way.
# The term "aggregation" means the following when applied to our journaling:
#  * ignore/hide old journal rows (since every journal row contains a full copy of the journaled
#    object, dropping intermediate rows will just increase the diff of the following journal)
#  * in case an older row had notes, take the notes from the older row, since they shall not
#    be dropped
